                Dog's known for their loyalty to their onwers is an undeniably reason any human would purchase one, in a
                world where loyalty comes with a price.
                <br> Apart from loyalty, dogs are treated as pet animals and very friendly types.<br> The most reason i
                like
                dog's is that they provide security services to the neighbourhood it is brought into, with its excellent
                sence of smell and vision, it can detect suspicious activities in the neighbourhood and alert it's
                owners.<br>
                Dog's are very necessary in military and police operation, because with their advanced sence of smell
                they
                can easily detect drug barons in transit.
